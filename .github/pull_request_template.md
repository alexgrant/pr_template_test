**PLEASE CHOOSE A PR TEMPLATE** by appending one of the following query parameters:
- for non-trivial tickets that warrant an over-the-shoulder review: `&template=ots.md` or `?template=ots.md`
- for simple changes where interrupting another's work for an OTS is overkill: `&template=async.md` or `?template=async.md`
- for merges from one release branch to another (or master): `&template=release.md` or `?template=release.md`
